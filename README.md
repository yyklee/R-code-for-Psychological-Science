# R-for-Psychological-Science
R syntax organized: for analyzing psychological experiments + survey data

## The repository includes:
1. [**Logistic Regression.R**](https://github.com/yyklee/R-for-Psychological-Science/blob/main/Logistic%20Regression.R): R Syntax for Logistic Regression <br />
      Use this modeling when your dependent variable is **discrete** _(e.g., yes/no, go/no-go)_. Mostly used to analyze rates. <br /> **-->For more info:** look at my summary of [_'Logistic regression and Extensions'_](https://github.com/yyklee/R-for-Psychological-Science/blob/main/Logistic%20Regression%20Review.pdf), which includes how to check data structure, how to perform sample pre-analysis and an overview of two research papers that used logistic regression.

2. [**Poisson Regression.R**](https://github.com/yyklee/R-for-Psychological-Science/blob/main/Poisson%20Regression.R): R Syntax for Poisson Regression<br />
      Poisson regression is used to predict a dependent variable that includes "count data" _(e.g., daily number of visits to the market)_. 

3. [**Multilevel Modeling.R**](https://github.com/yyklee/R-for-Psychological-Science/blob/main/Multilevel%20Modeling.R): R Syntax for MLM <br />
      Use this modeling when your data structure includes more than two level; nested structure _(e.g., individuals nested in country, daily measures nested in individuals)_. <br /> **-->For more info:**  look at my review paper of [_'Multilevel regression'_](https://github.com/yyklee/R-for-Psychological-Science/blob/main/Multilevel%20Modeling_research_review.pdf), which analyzes two papers that used multilevel modeling. 

4. [**Cross classified multilevel modeling.R**](https://github.com/yyklee/R-for-Psychological-Science/blob/main/Cross%20classified%20multilevel%20modeling.R): R Syntax for Cross-classified MLM<br />
      Crossing two or more higher level classifications with one another _(e.g., individuals in Region and Company)_<br />**-->To understand this model:**  I found [this paper](https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fpspi0000160) helpful. Tools for calculating ICCs in cross-classified model can be found in this [lab page](http://hehmanlab.org/toolbox).
